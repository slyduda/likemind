**Entities** are the main data model of **likemind**. Entities are things with distinct existences and include a general name and relevant metadata. In an effort to not make any opinions about how our users intend to use the app, we are not making any assumptions about specific data that we should collect for **entities**. Though the following types and guidelines exist in order to create some kind of loose structure in the early stages of the application.

## Types

Likemind tracks a variety of **entities** in order to provide a ride variety of research use cases for users. The following types of **entities** are organizations, brands, and people of interest.

### Organizations

Organizations are organized bodies of people with a purpose. These may include, but are not limited to: businesses, governments, associations, and more.

### Brands

Brands are a type of product usually created by organizations under a particular name. Brands may share the same name as their creator, but are redundantly duplicated to create a clear separation between products and their creators. For example, XYZ org may have two products called ABC and XYZ where the latter product matches the company's name. Three **entities** are created in **likemind** in order to map issues across products and their creators more effectively.

### People of Interest

People of interest are individuals who have significant influence or power usually in the corporate world, but also in political or social power (they overlap). People of interest are not necessarily people who only have power over a very small subset of individuals. Their power is usually widespread and may include: politicians, government officials, some exectutives, celebrities, etc.
