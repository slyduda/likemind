## Activities

**Activities** are actions that **entities** take throughout their lifetimes. These are ranked by users and filtered by the communities that you interact with so that you are served relevant content.

**Activities** are the core data model that supports the app and the ability to get relative quantitative information about each entity. They are reviewed by users in terms of *importance*, *impact*, and *sentiment*.
