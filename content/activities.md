**Activities** are single points in time or durations of time in which one or more **entities** engage or participate in some action. **Activities** consist of a description of the action, relevant resources that corroborate that the action did take place, the **entities** involved in the action in the form of [involvements](/involvements), and a list of [tags](/tags) that help categorize **activities**.

## Time

The start time of an **activity** refers to the start date and time of the relevant action. All activities have a start date.

The end time of an **activity** refers to the end date and time of a relevant action. An **activity** without an end time implies that the **activity** is still ongoing. Alternatively, an **activity** with an end time that is the same as the start time implies that the **activity** was a single event without a duration of time.

## Reviews

**Activities** are reviewed by users in order to associate the sentiment of actions that **entities** participate in, in an effort to gain a better understanding of the actions that related **entities** are potentially contributing to either directly or indirecty. Activities are rated by users in order to gather these three qualitative metrics:

### Importance

How important the **activity** is in respect to other **activities** happening around the world. Think of upvoting and downvoting, but with a slight addition to the scale to add more weight if necessary. This helps us serve relevant content to each user on the app.

### Impact

How impactful you think the **entity** was in contributing to the **activity**. In the event where an **activity** only has one **entity** associated to it, this will more likely than not be 100. **Likemind** allows users to group the **involvement** of many **entities** in a single **activity** though. Because of this not every **entity** may contribute equally.

### Sentiment

How you view the **activity** in terms of how it affects communties and stakeholders. In simpler terms, how good or bad you think an **entity's** **involvement** was in an **activity**.

These three metrics, help us draw a bigger picture among all of the interconnected relationships among corporations and organizations. As mentioned earlier as well, these data points help us serve relevant content to users by recommending activities to you if we see similar patterns in sentiment and impact
